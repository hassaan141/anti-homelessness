Hi there! I'm Owend, the manager of this grocery store.

To help me organize our inventory, I'd like to categorize our groceries into sections where we typically see them in a grocery store. Here's what I've come up with:

**Meat Department**
• Bacon
• Beef
• Chicken
• Ground beef
• Pork

**Dairy Section**
• Butter
• Cheese
• Eggs
• Milk
• Yogurt

**Dry Goods**
• Cereal
• Flour
• Pasta
• Rice
• Sugar

**Produce**
• Apples
• Bananas
• Carrots
• Celery
• Oranges

**Pantry**
• Almond butter
• Baking powder
• Canned goods (beans, tomatoes, etc.)
• Coffee
• Granola
• Oats

**Snacks**
• Chips
• Crackers
• Popcorn kernels
• Pretzels
• Trail mix

**Beverages**
• Juice boxes
• Milkshakes
• Soda
• Water

Now that we have our categories organized, let me know if you'd like to add or move anything!
